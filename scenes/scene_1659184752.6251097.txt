The man who was left alone at the chess table sits fuming for a few moments, before getting up and walking away himself. He kicks at the chess pieces as he goes, muttering to himself in anger. As he walks, he notices a group of children playing nearby and he stops to watch them for a moment. A smile slowly spreads across his face as he watches their happy faces and hears their laughter. He shakes his head and continues on his way, his anger forgotten.
