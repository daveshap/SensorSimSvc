The man who lost the game walks away from the chess table, muttering to himself. He is clearly angry and is planning his revenge against the man who won. He walks with purpose, his mind focused on getting even. The other man simply smiles and enjoys the day, looking forward to the next game. He is unaware of the man's plans for revenge.
