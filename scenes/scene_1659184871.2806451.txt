The two men finish their game of chess and shake hands. They pack up their chess set and walk off in different directions. As they walk away, they notice a group of children playing tag. One of the men, smiling to himself, remembers playing tag with his own children when they were that age. The other man, not wanting to be reminded of his own children who are now grown and live far away, quickens his pace and disappears into the crowd.
