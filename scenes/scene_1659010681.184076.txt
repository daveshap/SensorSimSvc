The two men walk away from the chess table, shaking hands. They part ways and each head in different directions. The sun continues to shine and the birds keep singing. The children can still be heard playing in the distance. One of the men, however, is not happy with the outcome of the game. He mutters to himself as he walks away, planning his revenge. The other man simply smiles and enjoys the day, looking forward to the next game.
