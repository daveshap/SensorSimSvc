The two men continue to play chess as the sun sets and the park becomes more quiet. The chess game becomes more intense as the men start to make more strategic moves. The men are both focused on the game, and don't notice as the park gradually empties out. As the game goes on, the men start to get more competitive, and the trash-talking starts. The men are so focused on the game that they don't notice the darkness creeping in, or the fact that they're now the only ones left in the park. Suddenly, the men are startled by a loud noise. They look around to see a group of teenagers, who are laughing and shouting as they run away. The men realize that they've been playing chess in the dark for hours, and they pack up their things and head home.
