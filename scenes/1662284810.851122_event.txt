The two men continue to play chess, now with money on the line. The sun continues to shine and the birds continue to sing, but the atmosphere is now tense. The children are still playing in the distance, but they seem further away. The horns honking and the bustle of New York seems louder and more chaotic. The two men are focused on the game, and their moves are now more deliberate. The stakes are high, and neither man wants to lose.
