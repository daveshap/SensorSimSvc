The two men are sitting in the park, playing chess. They've been playing for hours, and the trash talk has gotten heated. Neither of them notices the empty park around them or the fact that they're the only ones left. Suddenly, they're startled by a loud noise. They look around to see a group of teenagers who are laughing and shouting as they run away. The men realize that they've been playing chess in the dark for hours, and they pack up their things and head home.
