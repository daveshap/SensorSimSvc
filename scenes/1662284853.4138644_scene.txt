The two men walk away from the chessboard, the winner counting his money and the loser sulking. The sun is still shining and the birds are still singing, but the atmosphere is now tense. The children are still playing in the distance, but they seem further away. The horns honking and the bustle of New York seems louder and more chaotic. The two men don't speak to each other as they walk away in opposite directions.
