The two men are sitting at a stone chess table in Central Park. They are playing chess. The sun is shining and birds are singing. It is a summer day. Children are running and playing in the distance. Horns honking and the bustle of New York can be heard in the background. One of the men loses his chess piece, becomes frustrated, and knocks over the chess board. The other man remains calm. The two men are still sitting at the stone chess table in Central Park. One of the men has knocked over the chess board in frustration. The sun is still shining and birds are still singing. Children are still running and playing in the distance. Horns honking and the bustle of New York can still be heard in the background.
