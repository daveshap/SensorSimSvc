The two men are engaged in a brutal fistfight. They are slamming each other into the concrete, punches landing with sickening thuds. Both men are bloody, and their clothes are in tatters. The chessboard is ruined, the pieces scattered and broken. The sun is still shining and birds are still singing. Children are still running and playing in the distance. Horns honking and the bustle of New York can still be heard in the background. One of the men gets in a lucky punch and knocks the other man unconscious. He falls to the ground with a thud, his head bouncing off the concrete. The victor stands over him, chest heaving, rage still in his eyes.
