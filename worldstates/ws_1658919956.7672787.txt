The police officer is still at the scene, reading the Miranda rights to the victor. The ambulance has left, taking the victor with it. The chessboard is still ruined, the pieces scattered and broken. The sun is still shining and birds are still singing. Children are still running and playing in the distance. Horns honking and the bustle of New York can still be heard in the background.
